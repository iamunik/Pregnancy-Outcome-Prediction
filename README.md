# 🩺 Pregnancy Delivery Mode Prediction System 🏥👶

### Overview  
This project is a **Machine Learning-Powered Pregnancy Delivery Mode Prediction System**, developed to assist healthcare
 professionals in determining the most likely mode of delivery—such as vaginal or cesarean—based on individual patient 
 data. By inputting relevant clinical parameters, medical personnel receive instant predictions, enhancing 
 decision-making during prenatal care.

### 🎯 Objectives  
- **Support Clinical Decision-Making**: Offer fast and accurate delivery mode predictions to assist healthcare 
providers.  
- **Highlight Risk Indicators**: Analyze patient data to identify factors that may necessitate a particular 
delivery method.  
- **Streamline User Experience**: Provide an intuitive and responsive interface for seamless data entry and 
result interpretation.

### 🔄 System Workflow  
1. **Clinical Data Entry**: Users input features such as maternal age, BMI, gestational age, and obstetric history.  
2. **Data Preprocessing**: The input is cleaned and prepared to meet the model’s requirements.  
3. **Model Prediction**: The Gradient Boosting model processes the data and predicts the likely delivery mode.  
4. **Result Visualization**: Results are displayed on the web interface, along with interpretive messages or warnings.

### ⚙️ Implementation Highlights  
- **Feature Selection**: Includes critical indicators such as age, body mass index, pregnancy count, and 
gestational age.  
- **Model Training**: Trained on historical delivery records to ensure robust, clinically relevant performance.  
- **User Interface**: Designed using Streamlit for ease of use in clinical settings, with fast feedback loops.
